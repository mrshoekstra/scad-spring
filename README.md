# 🧊 SCAD Spring <picture><img alt="OpenSCAD" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenSCAD-9dcb51"></picture>
A scripted CAD (OpenSCAD) project for generating a customizable, parametric flat spring as a 3D model, fully script driven for easy adjustment of dimensions and properties. The included SCAD file works with the OpenSCAD Customizer, allowing you to generate custom STL files for 3D printing and prototyping.
